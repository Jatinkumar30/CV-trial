/* its nice to look your body code in devtool in chrome because it will help u in making a healthy debug habit...just like u forgot here that at fisrt i updated h1 but when i use id..then id override the tag selector...so its nice to look up your code in chrome inspect body 

---------------
class can be used of same name but not in id
class is used when things belongs to same kind of group
but id is used when something used which is not in bulk
like main heading..only one heading is there
so id used for less and class for bulk

----------------

many css is applied at default by brower
so u can override them by using selector because they have highest priority level

--------------------
we also have psuedo classes which are invoked by adding :"psuedo class type" along with tag selector name
